### BACKGROUND
I was born in Nara prefecture in Japan and I grew up in Hong Kong when I was elementary school student. I had been longing for robotics engineering and I studied mechanical engineering at [Kansai University](http://www.kansai-u.ac.jp/English/).

After doing my first internship as a backend enginner at [Rich Media Co., Ltd](http://www.rich.co.jp/), I started to think that I want to make the world a better place by developing software with startup company.

Then I studied fundamentals of software development and did internship in Bangalore, India, by using  [Tobitate! Study Abroad Initiative](http://www.tobitate.mext.go.jp/about/english.html) program provided by the Japanese government. After that, I studied English and researched  startup culture in Silicon Valley Bay Area by using [Tobitate! Study Abroad Initiative](http://www.tobitate.mext.go.jp/about/english.html) as well.
